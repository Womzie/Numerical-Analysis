     Finding all roots of a Polynomial
       Using Newton's Method

Write a program that uses Newton's method
to find ALL of the roots of a polynomial,
even the complex roots.

The user of the program should only enter the
information that describes the polynomial :

  the degree of the polynomial first
  then the leading coefficient, on and on until 
  finally the constant coefficient.

For example, if the polynomial is
   2x^5 + 7x^4 - 9x^3 + 17x^2 + 30x -12

then the input will be

    5  (this is the degree)
    2  (this is the leading coefficient)
    7
    -9
    17
    30
   -12 (this is the constant coefficient)
   
    
The program should generate its own guesses
for the Newton's method algorithm.  These
guesses should have a non-zero imaginary
part if you wish to find the complex roots...
starting with a real guess will only find
a real root.

Once Newton's method finds its first root,
use synthetic division to deflate the polynomial
and then proceed to find a root of the defalted
poly.  Once a root is found for this deflated
polynomial, deflate again and continue until
all roots have been found.

We recommend just running Newton's method 50 times
for each root....this will probably work well
enough.

Synthetic division must be used not only for deflating
the polynomial but also for evaluating the polynomial
and it derivative.  

Several test cases have been suplied in the file

poly_tests.txt

Your code should work on the vast majority of these
test cases though a single exception will not be judged
as a blemish.
