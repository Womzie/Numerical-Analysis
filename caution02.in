inconsistent ... r2 = 3r1 - r3 + r4
except for the right hand side of row 2
if you had 29 instead of 29.001 it would
be consistent but underdetermined.


BUT gauss_elimC.c  thinks that there is
a unique solution (very big numbers).

gausselim_better.c correctly realizes that
this system does not have a unique solution.
